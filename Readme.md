## Project I : Exploring Weather Trends
In this project, we analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where you live to overall global temperature trends.

In this project, We analyze a TMDb (The Movie Database) dataset and then communicate our findings about it. This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb),including user ratings and revenue.
