# Data-Analyst-NanoDegree-Udacity

## Project I : Exploring Weather Trends
In this project, we analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where you live to overall global temperature trends.

## Project II : Investigate a Dataset TmDb Movies
In this project, We analyze a TMDb (The Movie Database) dataset and then communicate our findings about it. This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb),including user ratings and revenue. We will use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make your analysis easier.

## Project III : Data Wrangling - WeRateDogs twitter account
In this project, We will gather data from twitter in different formats to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations by cleaning the data.

## Project IV : ABTesting
##### Analyze-AB-Test-Results
In this project a dataset containing the conversion rates between new and old websites for an e-commerce website is going to be analyzed. This project is meant to give a practical example for how the statistics learned in part 4 of the Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree course can be used.

The data will be used to perform an A/B test, the goal is to work through the notebook to help the community understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old one or run the experiment longer to make their decision.


## Project V : Data Exploration
##### Communicate-Data-Findings
In this project, we use Pythonâ€™s data visualization tools to systematically explore the Ford GoBike System for its properties and relationships between variables. Then, we create a presentation that communicates ours findings to others.
