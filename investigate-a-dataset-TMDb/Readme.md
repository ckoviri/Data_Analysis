In this project, We analyze a TMDb (The Movie Database) dataset and then communicate our findings about it. This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb),including user ratings and revenue. We will use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make your analysis easier.
